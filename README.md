# OnlineSchoolData

This project was done in conjunction with the Rice County schoolboard. During the pandemic, they offered online schooling to every child in their district. One school board member who had long advocated for pushing the school district's start time back wanted me to look at the login & session data from their online schooling site. I sought to produce a chronological heatmap, showing how the number of active login sessions changed throughout the day.
